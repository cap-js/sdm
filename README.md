## Pre-Requisites
* Node.JS 16 or higher

* SAP Build WorkZone should be subscribed to view the HTML5Applications.
* [MTAR builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mbt) (`npm install -g mbt`)
* [Cloud Foundary CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html), Install cf-cli and run command `cf install-plugin multiapps`.

## Setup

In this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base application, to integrate SDM CAP plugin.

### Using the released version
If you want to use the released version of SDM CAP plugin follow the below steps:

1. Clone the incidents-app repository:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app.git
```

2. Navigate to incidents-app root folder and checkout to the branch **incidents-app-deploy**:

```sh
   git checkout incidents-app-deploy
```

3. Install SDM CAP plugin by executing the following command:

```sh
   npm add @cap-js/sdm
```

### Using the development version
If you want to use the version under development follow the below steps:

1. Clone the sdm repository:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cap-js/sdm.git
```

2. Open terminal, navigate to sdm root folder and generate tarball:

```sh
   npm pack

   This will generate a file with name cap-js-sdm-x.y.z.tgz
```

3. Clone the incidents-app repository:

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app.git
```

4. Navigate to incidents-app root folder and checkout to the branch **incidents-app-deploy**:

```sh
   git checkout incidents-app-deploy
```

5. Copy the path of .tgz file generated in step 2 and in terminal navigate to incidents-app root folder and execute:

```sh
   npm install <path-to-.tgz file>
```

## Use @cap-js/sdm plugin

**To use sdm plugin in incidents-app, create an element with an `Attachments` type.** Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), create a separate file _db/attachments.cds_ and paste the below content in it:

```
using { sap.capire.incidents as my } from './schema';
using { Attachments } from '@cap-js/sdm';

extend my.Incidents with { attachments: Composition of many Attachments }
```

Create a SAP Document Management Integration Option [Service instance and key](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/sap-document-management-service/creating-service-instance-and-service-key). Using credentials from key [onboard a repository](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/sap-document-management-service/onboarding-repository) and configure the onboarded repositoryId under cds.requires in package.json

```
"sdm": {
   "settings": {
   "repositoryId": "<repository-Id>"
   }
}
```

## Deploying and testing the application

1. Log in to Cloud Foundry space:

   ```sh
   cf login -a <CF-API> -o <ORG-NAME> -s <SPACE-NAME>
   ```

2. Bind CAP application to SAP Document Management Integration Option. Check the following reference from `mta.yaml` of Incidents Management app

   ```
   modules:
      - name: incidents-srv
      type: nodejs
      path: gen/srv
      requires:
         - name: sdm-di-instance
  
   resources:
      - name: sdm-di-instance
      type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
      parameters:
         service: sdm
         service-plan: standard
   ```

3. Build the project by running following command from root folder of incidents-app.
   ```sh
   mbt build
   ```
   Above step will generate .mtar file inside mta_archives folder.

4. Deploy the application
   ```sh
   cf deploy mta_archives/*.mtar
   ```

5. Launch the application
   ```sh
   * Navigate to Html5Applications menu in BTP subaccount and open the application (nsincidents v1.0.0) in a browser.
   * Click on incident with title Solar panel broken.
   ```  

6. The `Attachments` type has generated an out-of-the-box Attachments table (see highlighted box) at the bottom of the Object page:
   <img width="1300" alt="Attachments Table" style="border-radius:0.5rem;" src="etc/facet.png">

7. **Upload a file** by going into Edit mode and either using the **Upload** button on the Attachments table or by drag/drop. Then click the **Save** button to have that file stored in SAP Document Management Integration Option. We demonstrate this by uploading the PDF file from [_xmpl/db/content/Solar Panel Report.pdf_](./xmpl/db/content/Solar%20Panel%20Report.pdf):
   <img width="1300" alt="Upload an attachment" style="border-radius:0.5rem;" src="etc/upload.gif">

8. **Open a file** by clicking on the attachment. We demonstrate this by opening the previously uploaded PDF file: `Solar Panel Report.pdf`
   <img width="1300" alt="Delete an attachment" style="border-radius:0.5rem;" src="etc/open.gif">

9. **Rename a file** by going into Edit mode and setting a new name for the file in the filename field. Then click the **Save** button to have that file renamed in SAP Document Management Integration Option. We demonstrate this by renaming the previously uploaded PDF file: `Solar Panel Report.pdf`
   <img width="1300" alt="Delete an attachment" style="border-radius:0.5rem;" src="etc/rename.gif">

10. **Delete a file** by going into Edit mode and selecting the file(s) and by using the **Delete** button on the Attachments table. Then click the **Save** button to have that file deleted from the resource (SAP Document Management Integration Option). We demonstrate this by deleting the previously uploaded PDF file: `Solar Panel Report_2024.pdf`
   <img width="1300" alt="Delete an attachment" style="border-radius:0.5rem;" src="etc/delete.gif">

## Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests:
```sh
npm run test
```
